Left shift a<<b a*2to the power b 

Right shift a>>b a/2to the power b

Ex: 6>>1 6=110 6>>1=11= 3 6/2=3

AND for competetive: check if the ith bit is 1 
ex: 010 left shift -> 10

Q) multiply a given x by 14 use bit operations 
A) 14= 1110 
	x<<4 =16x
		-x<<1=2x

NOT ~(110)=001

XOR   a^a=0
      a^0=a
	a^b=c
	b^c=a
Q) Find a number is odd or even 
A) and with 1 

Q) Find power of 2
	bool is_pow(int x)
	{
		return (x||!(x&(x-1));
	}

Q) Number of 1's in binary representation 
	while(x)
	{
		if(x&1)
			ctr++;
		x>>1;
	}
	GREEDY
